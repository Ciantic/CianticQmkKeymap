# VSCode Keymap inside a dev container

This is my keymap, inside the VSCode devcontainer

## Before opening this in VSCode

Following must be done because of issue [#306](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/306) in vscode:

1.  Open `devcontainer.json`
2.  Replace `C:\\Source\\CandCPP\\CianticQmkKeymap\\` with the path to this folder.

If the above issue is fixed this can be replaced. 

## Open with VSCode

When opening, choose "Reopen in Container".
